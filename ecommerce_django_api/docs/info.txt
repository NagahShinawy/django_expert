3- SECRET KEY
3-  the secret key is a unique and confidential string used for cryptographic signing and securing various aspects of a Django application.
It is an important security measure to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

The secret key is typically defined in the settings.py file of a Django project.
It is recommended to keep the secret key confidential and not share it publicly or include it in version control repositories.

To generate a secret key, Django provides a built-in django.core.management.utils.get_random_secret_key() function that can be used.
You can assign the generated key to the SECRET_KEY variable in your Django settings file.

It's important to note that when deploying a Django application to a production environment, it's advisable to store the secret key securely and configure it through environment variables or a secure key management system rather than hardcoding it in the settings file.
This helps maintain good security practices and allows for easier key rotation if necessary.
